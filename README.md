IMPLEMENTATION OF CAESAR CIPHER IN PYTHON
I recently delved into cryptography by creating a Caesar cipher program from scratch! This classic encryption technique, also known as a shift cipher, is a fundamental concept in the world of cryptography. By shifting letters in the alphabet by a set key value, the Caesar cipher encodes and decodes messages, providing an introduction to more complex encryption methods.
ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings:
Encryption & Decryption: Implemented the core principles of encrypting and decrypting text using a shift key.
String Manipulation: Gained practical experience with string operations, handling both uppercase and lowercase inputs.
Modular Arithmetic: Applied modular arithmetic to ensure the cipher correctly wraps around the end of the alphabet.
This hands-on project deepened my understanding of basic cryptographic techniques and improved my skills in Python programming. Excited to explore more advanced algorithms and encryption methods in future projects!
