IMPLEMENTATION OF CAESAR CIPHER IN PYTHON
I recently delved into cryptography by creating a Caesar cipher program from scratch! This classic encryption technique, also known as a shift cipher, is a fundamental concept in the world of cryptography. By shifting letters in the alphabet by a set key value, the Caesar cipher encodes and decodes messages, providing an introduction to more complex encryption methods.

Implemented the core principles of encrypting and decrypting text using a shift key, Gained practical experience with string operations, handling both uppercase and lowercase inputs and Applied modular arithmetic to ensure the cipher correctly wraps around the end of the alphabet.
